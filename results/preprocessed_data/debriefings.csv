prolific_id,Q0,Q1,Q2,Q3,Q4
sub001,No,Shape and curvature ,Most of the time yes,No,No
sub002,no,i looked at the overall shape and then the curve of the edges,yes,no,no
sub003,No. It was all clear,By the straight or curvy lines. I tried to make a quick judgement on rough shape,Yes,No,This was very interesting. I was annoyed when I felt I got one wrong!
sub005,"No, it wasn't. Everything was clear.",The one that was more a like the target.,I had enough time for each trial.,I did not encounter any technical difficulties.,The study was interesting and easy to complete.
sub006,No,Looking at the overall shapes of all without focusing on one,yes,no,no
sub007,"No, nothing was unclear in the instructions","Depending on whether the edges were rounded or angled, depending on the size and which shape had a similar area.",I think I missed the time limit on 5 or 6 occasions,No,"No, I enjoyed this and based on results, it looks like I did well!"
sub008,no,I looked at how round or sharp they are compared to others. if they were similar in shape I looked at the surface they have on top,yes,no,a timer for the break would help as I cannot approximate how long 30 sec after the 3rd trial
sub009,no,looking at how sharp or unsharp the object was and comparing which one it was closer to,yes,no,no!
sub010,No,Looked to see whether the shape was more round or sharper than the target object,No,None ,None
sub011,No.,By studying the shape of all three objects.,Yes.,No.,No.
sub012,they were clear,"by the angle, if they have a straight or curve lines",yes,"in the last trial, some images didnt appear (from 58/82)",-
sub013,No,Curve and length of the sides,Yes,No,No
sub014,no,Q for the 1 on the left and P for the 1 on the right,yes,no,the time given to answer is slightly too long and I started to 2nd guess my answers instead of being the knee-jerk reaction I had to start with.
